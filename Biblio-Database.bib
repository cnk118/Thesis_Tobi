abstract = {The effects of MgO on sintering and grain growth of alu- mina in the absence of any other impurities as well as in the presence of various amounts of CaO were investigated using ultrapure ({\textgreater}99.999 {\%}) alumina and sintering at 1900°C for 1 h in a clean contamination-free condition. Critical concen- trations of MgO required for the prevention of abnormal grain growth were linearly dependent on the CaO concen- tration. For a given concentration of CaO, at least the same amount of MgO has to be added to prevent abnormal grain growth. MgO addition alone to the ultrapure alumina enhanced both grain growth and densification kinetics dur- ing pressureless sintering. The beneficial effect of MgO dop- ing could not be explained based on the solute drag (or pinning) model. It was more likely to be understood in terms of either a glass modification model or a solid-liquid interface modification model. 1.},

abstract = {The kinetics of densification and grain growth of ultrapure alumina ({\textgreater} 99.999{\%}) were measured for clean sintering conditions in a pure-sapphire tube, and compared with kinetics measured during normal sintering conditions in an alumina crucible of 99.8{\%} purity. For the clean condition, the microstructure of sintered alumina remained homogeneous and only normal grain growth was observed up to 1900°C for 5 H. However, under the normal sintering condition, both normal and abnormal grain growth were observed depending on the sintering temperature and time. Thus, abnormal grain growth in alumina could be effectively suppressed without introducing sintering aids (such as MgO) by using an ultrapure powder and by preventing the introduction of any impurities throughout the sintering process. This result strongly suggests that abnormal grain in commercially pure alumina (⩽ 99.99{\%}) is not an intrinsic property of alumina but an extrinsic property controlled by minor constituents that can be present in the original powder or introduced during powder processing and subsequent sintering.},

@article{Frueh2016,
abstract = {? 2016 The American Ceramic SocietyTo determine how grain-boundary composition affects the liquid phase sintering of MgO-free Bayer process aluminas, samples were singly or co-doped with up to 1029 ppm Na2O and 603 ppm SiO2 and heated at 1525?C up to 8 h. Na2O retards densification of samples from the onset of sintering and up to hold times of 30 min at 1525?C compared to the undoped samples, but similar to the as-received, MgO-free Al2O3, Na2O-doped samples sinter to 98{\%} density with average grain sizes of {\~{}}3 ?m after 8 h. Increasing SiO2 concentration significantly retards densification at all hold times up to 8 h. The estimated viscosities (20?400 Pa?s) of the 0.3 to 1.8 nm thick siliceous grain-boundary films in this study indicate that diffusion greatly depends on the composition of the liquid grain-boundary phase. For low Na2O/SiO2 ratios, densification of Bayer Al2O3 at 1525?C is controlled by diffusion of Al3+ through the grain-boundary liquid, whereas for high Na2O/SiO2 ratios, densification can be governed by either the interface reaction (i.e., dissolution) of Al2O3 or diffusion of Al3+. Increasing Na2O in SiO2-doped samples increases diffusion of Al3+ and Al2O3 solubility in the liquid, and thus densification increases by 1{\%}. Based on these findings, we conclude that Bayer Al2O3 densification can be manipulated by adjusting the Na2O to SiO2 ratio.},

abstract = {Trace SiO2 and MgO additive distributions in sintered alumina have been studied using high-resolution scanning secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). When doped with each additive individually, evidence is seen for both strong silicon segregation to grain boundaries (Cgb/Cgrain similar/congruent 300) in SiO2-doped alumina and strong magnesium segregation to grain boundaries (Cgb/Cgrain similar/congruent 400) in MgO-doped alumina. When codoped with both SiO2and MgO, segregation of both ions to grain boundaries is reduced by a factor of 5 or more over single doping. The additive concentrations increase proportionally in the grains, and both dopants become more uniformly distributed throughout the bulk. It is concluded that codoping with these additives increases their mutual bulk solid solubility and decreases their interfacial segregation over single doping. The beneficial effect of MgO additions in controlling microstructure development in alumina and improving corrosion resistance to aqueous HF stems from its ability to redistribute silicon ions from grain boundaries into the bulk.},

The chemical impurities in the samples were exsolved at a lower temperature than the sintering temperature and measured by SEM/EDS to determine the correlation between the distribution of impuri- ties and the microstructure in A1,03. A feature of this study was the use of clean-room processing and firing procedures to maintain sample composition at the levels initially present in the starting powders. As the local concentrations of chemical impurities (i.e., Si, Ca) increased, the grain boundary-grain boundary dihedral angle distribution widened, with many angles at MOO, the grain-size distribution widened, and pore-boundary separation was enhanced. Discontinuous grain growth was observed in regions of undoped AI2O3 containing the largest Ca and Si concentrations. It is suggested that doping with MgO solute reduces the effects of impurities on grain growth by increasing the bulk solubility and decreasing interfacial segregation of impurities, especially Si, and by narrowing the distribution of grain boundary-grain bound- ary dihedral angles},

On that purpose, the amounts of Na2O and SiO2 present in a commercial powder, have been modified by doping. The sintering behavior and the microstructure of the sintered ceramics have been investigated. The ratio Na2O/SiO2 strongly influences the shrinkage rates during sintering, the final density and the microstructure. From the commercial powder used (P172SB, Aluminium Pechiney Company, Alcan Group, France), it is shown that an increase in Na2O content significantly slows down the densification and also the grain growth. The effect of an increase in SiO2 additions is less obvious even if the dilatometric curves also show decreases in the sintering rates, particularly in the temperature range 1200-1400 ??C. Contrary to Na2O, the addition of SiO2 leads to abnormal grain growth and provokes an increase in the aspect ratio of the grains. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Using an efficient strain-stress method, the first-principles elastic constants c i j 's of $\alpha$ - Al 2 O 3 and $\theta$ - Al 2 O 3 have been predicted within the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation. It is indicated that more accurate calculations of c i j 's can be accomplished by the local density approximation. The predicted c i j 's of $\theta$ - Al 2 O 3 provide helpful guidance for future measurements, especially the predicted negative c 15 . The present results make the stress estimation in thermally grown oxides containing of $\alpha$ - and $\theta$ - Al 2 O 3 possible, which in turn provide helpful insights for preventing the failure of thermal barrier coatings on components in gas-turbine engines.},

abstract = {In certain ceramics like Si3N4, SiC, SrTiO3, Al2O3, etc., the grain boundary (GB) region can have an amorphous film of about 1-2 nm thickness. These intergranular glassy films (IGFs) are characterized by a nearly constant thickness which is basically independent of the orientation of the bounding grains, but is dependent on the composition of the ceramic. The IGF is resistant to crystallization and is thought to represent an equilibrium configuration. The presence of the IGF, along with its structure, plays an important role in determining the properties of the ceramic as a whole. Important amongst these properties, keeping in mind the system based specificities, are fracture, creep, oxidation and electrical behaviour. Depending on the system, various synthetic routes like liquid phase sintering, solid-state activated sintering, crystallization of glass surrounding the crystal, etc., have led to the formation of IGFs. Equilibrium thickness amorphous films on surfaces have also been synthesized which are considered to be the surface analogue of IGFs. Important advances in the microscopy techniques have provided invaluable insights into the structure of IGFs, along with its interface with the bounding crystals. These techniques include: high-resolution microscopy, Fresnel contrast imaging, diffuse dark field imaging, diffraction analysis, electron holography, high-angle annular dark field imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and electron energy loss spectroscopy. It is now being progressively realized that the composition and structure within the IGF is graded, i.e., it has a diffuse interface with the bounding crystals and that the amorphous material in the IGF is different from the bulk glass forming in that system. The order induced by the bounding crystals on the IGF is seen as a contributing factor to the gradation. In spite of the achievements, a lot of open questions remain regarding the formation of IGFs, its behaviour with temperature, its dependence on crystallography of the bounding grains, etc. This overview aims at introducing IGFs to a non-specialist audience, summarizing the important advances in the field and outlining the outstanding issues. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of Al, Ni, NiAl, and Ni3Al were studied using the first-principles approach. The 0-K total energies are calculated using the ab initio plane wave pseudopotential method within the generalized gradient approximation. The contribution to the free energy from the lattice vibration was calculated using the phonon densities of states derived by means of the ab initio linear-response theory. The thermal electronic contribution to the free energy was obtained from the one-dimensional numerical integration over the electronic density of states. With the deduced Helmholtz free-energy, the thermal expansion and enthalpy as a function of temperature were calculated and compared with the experimental data. Our calculations show that the enthalpies of formation are slightly temperature dependent with a slope of −1.6 J/mol/K for NiAl and −1.2 J/mol/K for Ni3Al. For Ni, the inclusion of thermal electronic excitation results in a 10{\%} increase in thermal expansion and 15{\%} increase in enthalpy at 1600 K.},
