abstract = {Master sintering curve (MSC) was used as a practical approach to analyse the sintering behavior of an ultrafine alumina powder. Non-isothermal sintering was carried out at three heating rates. The concept of the MSC has been used to investigate the effect of different shaping methods, i.e. dry pressing (DP) and pressure filtration (PF) on the apparent activation energy for sintering. Although no change in the dominant densification mechanism is expected, the interplay between different diffusion mechanisms taking place during the heating ramp may be affected by the shaping method. Values of 605 ?? 15 and 700 ?? 20kJ/mol were determined for PF and DP samples, respectively. The lower activation energy for PF samples may be explained by the higher green density and homogeneity, smaller pore size in comparison with the DP samples. Furthermore, the mechanical properties (hardness and fracture toughness) of the samples are presented. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The kinetics of densification and grain growth of ultrapure alumina ({\textgreater} 99.999{\%}) were measured for clean sintering conditions in a pure-sapphire tube, and compared with kinetics measured during normal sintering conditions in an alumina crucible of 99.8{\%} purity. For the clean condition, the microstructure of sintered alumina remained homogeneous and only normal grain growth was observed up to 1900°C for 5 H. However, under the normal sintering condition, both normal and abnormal grain growth were observed depending on the sintering temperature and time. Thus, abnormal grain growth in alumina could be effectively suppressed without introducing sintering aids (such as MgO) by using an ultrapure powder and by preventing the introduction of any impurities throughout the sintering process. This result strongly suggests that abnormal grain in commercially pure alumina (⩽ 99.99{\%}) is not an intrinsic property of alumina but an extrinsic property controlled by minor constituents that can be present in the original powder or introduced during powder processing and subsequent sintering.},

abstract = {The master sintering curve (MSC) is a simple and functional sinter model that is used to describe the densification of a particulate material during sintering when one sintering mechanism is dominant. Usually the MSC is expressed mathematically by a sigmoid relationship between the natural logarithm of the work of sintering and the relative density. The work of sintering is an integral term that includes the time and temperature path followed by the material during sintering as well as the apparent activation energy for densification of the material. In this work, the sigmoid form of the MSC is linearized by relating the natural logarithm of the work of sintering to the densification parameter. Linearization of the MSC simplifies the characterization of the model parameters. This is illustrated by example of different powder metal systems, showing how the linearized MSC model parameters can be easily determined directly from the plotted experimental data.},

In this study, the master sintering curve concept is applied to several powder metal systems: 17 to 4PH stainless steel, 316L stainless steel, nickel, niobium, tungsten heavy alloys with two different compositions, and molybdenum. A detailed explanation of the construction of these curves is given, including methods used to calculate the apparent activation energy for sintering and to curve-fit experimental data to a sigmoid function describing the master sintering curve.

abstract = {The fundamental question as to whether thin intergranular films can adopt an equilibrium thickness in polycrystalline ceramics is addressed. Two continuum approaches are presented, one based on interfacial energies and the other on the force balance normal to the boundary. These indicate that there will exist a stable thickness for the intergranular film and that it will be of the order of 1 nm. The origin of an equilibrium thickness is shown to be the result of two competing interactions, an attractive van der Waals-disperson interaction between the grains on either side of the boundary acting to thin the film and a repulsive term, due to the structure of the intergranular liquid, opposing this attraction. As both of these interactions are of short range ({\textless}10 nm), it is a natural consequence that the equilibrium thickness is of the order of 1 nm, a value commensurate with that observed experimentally in a wide range of ceramics. Two further consequences of importance arc indicated. The first is that thin intergranular liquid phases can support a normal stress. The second is that the dielectric constants of the adjacent grains play an important role in determining the thicknesses of the intergranular phase. This leads to the conclusion, consistent with observations, that the thickness of the intergranular phase in polyphase ceramics is expected to be different at boundaries between dissimilar phases than that between like phases.},

abstract = {The role of additives has long been a theme in sintering science. Recently, it has been discovered that ceramics may contain multiple different grain boundary phases (complexions) that are chemically induced by certain additives. These complexions are useful in explaining a number of anomalous phenomena associated with sintering, such as abnormal grain growth. The current work investigates how transitions between these complexions occur and at which grain boundaries they are most likely to occur. The number of complexion transitions that occur increases linearly with grain size (grain boundary excess concentration), and exponentially with temperature. The results suggest that grain boundary energy and anisotropy are important in predicting which and how many grain boundaries will undergo such a transition. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Na2O retards densification of samples from the onset of sintering and up to hold times of 30 min at 1525?C compared to the undoped samples, but similar to the as-received, MgO-free Al2O3, Na2O-doped samples sinter to 98{\%} density with average grain sizes of {\~{}}3 ?m after 8 h. Increasing SiO2 concentration significantly retards densification at all hold times up to 8 h. The estimated viscosities (20?400 Pa?s) of the 0.3 to 1.8 nm thick siliceous grain-boundary films in this study indicate that diffusion greatly depends on the composition of the liquid grain-boundary phase. For low Na2O/SiO2 ratios, densification of Bayer Al2O3 at 1525?C is controlled by diffusion of Al3+ through the grain-boundary liquid, whereas for high Na2O/SiO2 ratios, densification can be governed by either the interface reaction (i.e., dissolution) of Al2O3 or diffusion of Al3+. Increasing Na2O in SiO2-doped samples increases diffusion of Al3+ and Al2O3 solubility in the liquid, and thus densification increases by 1{\%}. Based on these findings, we conclude that Bayer Al2O3 densification can be manipulated by adjusting the Na2O to SiO2 ratio.},

When doped with each additive individually, evidence is seen for both strong silicon segregation to grain boundaries (Cgb/Cgrain similar/congruent 300) in SiO2-doped alumina and strong magnesium segregation to grain boundaries (Cgb/Cgrain similar/congruent 400) in MgO-doped alumina. When codoped with both SiO2and MgO, segregation of both ions to grain boundaries is reduced by a factor of 5 or more over single doping. The additive concentrations increase proportionally in the grains, and both dopants become more uniformly distributed throughout the bulk. It is concluded that codoping with these additives increases their mutual bulk solid solubility and decreases their interfacial segregation over single doping. The beneficial effect of MgO additions in controlling microstructure development in alumina and improving corrosion resistance to aqueous HF stems from its ability to redistribute silicon ions from grain boundaries into the bulk.},

@article{Handwerker1989,
abstract = {Effects of chemical inhomogeneities and single-crystal seeds on normal and discontinuous grain growth were investigated in both undoped and MgO-doped A1203. The chemical impurities in the samples were exsolved at a lower temperature than the sintering temperature and measured by SEM/EDS to determine the correlation between the distribution of impuri- ties and the microstructure in A1,03. A feature of this study was the use of clean-room processing and firing procedures to maintain sample composition at the levels initially present in the starting powders. As the local concentrations of chemical impurities (i.e., Si, Ca) increased, the grain boundary-grain boundary dihedral angle distribution widened, with many angles at MOO, the grain-size distribution widened, and pore-boundary separation was enhanced. Discontinuous grain growth was observed in regions of undoped AI2O3 containing the largest Ca and Si concentrations. It is suggested that doping with MgO solute reduces the effects of impurities on grain growth by increasing the bulk solubility and decreasing interfacial segregation of impurities, especially Si, and by narrowing the distribution of grain boundary-grain bound- ary dihedral angles},

abstract = {By focusing on the similarities between the three stages of sintering, a single equation is derived that quantifies sintering as a continuous process from beginning to end. The microstructure is characterized by two separate parameters representing geometry and scale. The dimensionless geometry parameter, denoted T, comprises five scaling factors that relate specific microstructural featuers (e.g., surface curvature) to the scale (grain diameter). Calculations of T from experimental data show (a) agreement with computer simulations of initial-stage sintering, (b) the effect of surface diffusion on T, and (c) changes in T with microstructural evolution during sintering. Application of the model to the design of firing schedules and the study of microstructural geometry effects on sintering is discussed.},

abstract = {The interface atomic structure was proposed to have a critical effect on microstructure evolution during sintering of ceramic materials. In liquid-phase sintering, spherical grains show normal grain growth behavior without exception, while angular grains often grow abnormally. The coarsening process of spherical grains with a disordered or rough interface atomic structure is diffusion-controlled, because there is little energy barrier for atomic attachments. On the other hand, kink-generating sources such as screw dislocations or two-dimensional (2-D) nuclei are required for angular grains having an ordered or singular interface structure. Coarsening of angular grains based on a 2-D nucleation mechanism could explain the abnormal grain growth behavior. It was also proposed that a densification process is closely related to the interface atomic structure. Enhanced densification by carefully chosen additives during solid state sintering was explained in terms of the grain-boundary structural transition from an ordered to a disordered open structure. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Ceramic Society.},

On that purpose, the amounts of Na2O and SiO2 present in a commercial powder, have been modified by doping. The sintering behavior and the microstructure of the sintered ceramics have been investigated. The ratio Na2O/SiO2 strongly influences the shrinkage rates during sintering, the final density and the microstructure. From the commercial powder used (P172SB, Aluminium Pechiney Company, Alcan Group, France), it is shown that an increase in Na2O content significantly slows down the densification and also the grain growth. The effect of an increase in SiO2 additions is less obvious even if the dilatometric curves also show decreases in the sintering rates, particularly in the temperature range 1200-1400 ??C. Contrary to Na2O, the addition of SiO2 leads to abnormal grain growth and provokes an increase in the aspect ratio of the grains. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Strain rates during sintering of alumina at different heating rates between 0.2 and 20 K/min have been measured non-contact using a thermooptical measuring technique. The shrinkage data were represented in a kinetic field diagram. It was shown that coarsening effects can be indirectly derived from the position and slope of iso-strain lines identified in the kinetic field. In addition temperature gradients which frequently lead to an erroneous interpretation of shrinkage kinetics were identified. Uni-axial loads up to 6 MPa were applied during sintering. The strain rates were measured parallel and perpendicular to the load. They were processed in separate kinetic field diagrams. It was shown that creep leads to a parallel shift of the iso-strain lines either to lower temperatures, for the strain rates parallel to the load, or to higher temperatures, for the strain rates perpendicular to the load. The individual kinetic field diagrams for a specific load were assembled in 3d, with the load used as z-axis. They formed a master sintering diagram (MSD) where the iso-strain lines were replaced by iso-strain surfaces. The parallel shift of the iso-strain lines with load enabled a simple representation of sintering kinetics for various loads during the entire range of densification, temperatures and heating rates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A simple two-dimensional packing model, consisting of arrays of circular particles, was used to calculate the free energy changes associated with the fdling of pores of different coordinations with liquid. The calculations were used to determine the equilibrium distributions of a liquid in different packing arrangements of particles. The effect of both the volume fraction of liquid and shrinkage on liquid distribution was examined. It was found that, when liquid redistribution can easily take place, the volume fraction of liquid phase, the pore size distribution of a powder compact, and the amount of densification that has occurred all influence the homogeneity of the distribution of the liquid phase. In addition, the model predicts that, as shrinkage occurs or as the volume fraction of liquid phase increases, the pores will try to fill sequentially in order of increasing size. A consequence of this sequential filling of the pores is that the radius of curvature of the liquid meniscus, and hence the driving force for liquid-phase sintering, changes systematically as shrinkage occurs. The modeling suggests that the driving force for sintering changes in a way that depends on the initial overall pore size distribution of the particle arrangement and the way the pore size distribution changes during sintering.},

@article{Subramaniam2006,
abstract = {In certain ceramics like Si3N4, SiC, SrTiO3, Al2O3, etc., the grain boundary (GB) region can have an amorphous film of about 1-2 nm thickness. These intergranular glassy films (IGFs) are characterized by a nearly constant thickness which is basically independent of the orientation of the bounding grains, but is dependent on the composition of the ceramic. The IGF is resistant to crystallization and is thought to represent an equilibrium configuration. The presence of the IGF, along with its structure, plays an important role in determining the properties of the ceramic as a whole. Important amongst these properties, keeping in mind the system based specificities, are fracture, creep, oxidation and electrical behaviour. Depending on the system, various synthetic routes like liquid phase sintering, solid-state activated sintering, crystallization of glass surrounding the crystal, etc., have led to the formation of IGFs. Equilibrium thickness amorphous films on surfaces have also been synthesized which are considered to be the surface analogue of IGFs. Important advances in the microscopy techniques have provided invaluable insights into the structure of IGFs, along with its interface with the bounding crystals. These techniques include: high-resolution microscopy, Fresnel contrast imaging, diffuse dark field imaging, diffraction analysis, electron holography, high-angle annular dark field imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and electron energy loss spectroscopy. It is now being progressively realized that the composition and structure within the IGF is graded, i.e., it has a diffuse interface with the bounding crystals and that the amorphous material in the IGF is different from the bulk glass forming in that system. The order induced by the bounding crystals on the IGF is seen as a contributing factor to the gradation. In spite of the achievements, a lot of open questions remain regarding the formation of IGFs, its behaviour with temperature, its dependence on crystallography of the bounding grains, etc. This overview aims at introducing IGFs to a non-specialist audience, summarizing the important advances in the field and outlining the outstanding issues. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Master Sintering Curve (MSC) is quite useful for analyzing the shrinkage behavior of ceramics. It is possible to compare shrinkage behavior using MSCs that are obtained from different filing profiles. In this study, shrinkage behavior during sintering of green bodies of several kinds of Al2O3 based ceramics were evaluated, using an electric furnace equipped with a dilatometer to be controlled based on the MSC theory. Although all of the samples shrank monotonically, shrinkage behavior depended on the additive and heating rate. The MSC theory was applied to analyze shrinkage behavior. As a result, a different MSC could be obtained in Al2O3 with and without the addition of MgO. In the pure Al2O3, a single MSC could be obtained from shrinkage curves by filing at a heating rate of 7.5-20 degrees C/min, though the shrinkage curve at a heating rate of 3-5 degrees C/min did not correspond with the MSC. In contrast, shrinkage curves at heating rate of 5-20 degrees C/min were converged in the case of the MgO doped Al2O3 to obtain a unique MSC independent of firing profile. Apparent activation energy for sintering was estimated as 555 kJ/mol in the pure Al2O3 and 880 kJ/mol in the MgO doped Al2O3. The firing profile to obtain a requested sintering shrinkage curve was predicted from the resultant MSC. A comparison between the predicted and the experimental shrinkage curves, showed good consistency, thus confirming that it is possible to control shrinkage behavior using the MSC.},

This deviation is greatest at 67 mol{\%} SiO2 and increases with decreasing temperature. These features may be most simply explained by the presence of “triclusters” consisting of a threefold coordinated oxygen to which one aluminate and two silicate tetrahedra are attached.

The contribution to the free energy from the lattice vibration was calculated using the phonon densities of states derived by means of the ab initio linear-response theory. The thermal electronic contribution to the free energy was obtained from the one-dimensional numerical integration over the electronic density of states. With the deduced Helmholtz free-energy, the thermal expansion and enthalpy as a function of temperature were calculated and compared with the experimental data. Our calculations show that the enthalpies of formation are slightly temperature dependent with a slope of −1.6 J/mol/K for NiAl and −1.2 J/mol/K for Ni3Al.

This segregation of specific ions to the interface enables formation of localized, ordered structures between the IGF and the crystal. However, the segregation behavior of the ions is anisotropic, depending on the orientation of the alpha-Al2O3 crystals. The results show that the enrichment of Ca atoms at the basal interface inhibits growth in the 0001{\textgreater} direction. However, at the (1120) prism plane, Ca ions have little effect on the epitaxial adsorption of Al and O ions from the IGF onto the (1120) surface. Increasing alumina concentration in the glassy IGF enhances adsorption of Al ions onto the prism surface, with little effect on the basal surface, indicating the tendency of growth in the 1120{\textgreater} direction on the prism plane, but limited growth on the basal plane. These results are consistent with the experimental data regarding anisotropic grain growth in alumina sintered in the presence of CAS IGFs.},
