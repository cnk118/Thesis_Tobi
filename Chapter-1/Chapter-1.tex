\section{section1.1}
Pestorius [200] developed an algorithm to investigate propagation of finite-am\-pli\-tude noise in pipes. His algorithm, based on weak shock theory, includes the effects of nonlinearity and tube wall boundary layer attenuation and dispersion. The hybrid time-frequency domain algorithm applies nonlinearity in the time domain, applies a fast Fourier transform (FFT), and then applies attenuation and dispersion in the frequency domain.  Then an inverse FFT is taken to return to the time domain to propagate to the next step.
